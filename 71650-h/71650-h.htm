<p class='c013'>OBJECT.—The National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People
is an organization composed of men and
women of all races and classes who believe
that the present widespread increase
of prejudice against colored races and
particularly the denial of rights and
opportunities to ten million Americans of
Negro descent is not only unjust and a
menace to our free institutions, but also
is a direct hindrance to World Peace
and the realization of Human Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>METHODS.—The encouragement of
education and efforts for social uplift; the
dissemination of literature; the holding of
mass meetings; the maintenance of a lecture
bureau; the encouragement of vigilance
committees; the investigation of complaints;
the maintenance of a Bureau of
Information; the publication of The
Crisis; the collection of facts and publication
of the truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>ORGANIZATION.—All interested
persons are urged to join our organization—associate
membership costs $1, and
contributing and sustaining members pay
from $2 to $25 a year.</p>

<p class='c012'>FUNDS.—We need $10,000 a year
for running expenses of this work and particularly
urge the necessity of gifts to help
on our objects.</p>

<p class='c012'>OFFICERS.—The officers of the
organization are:</p>

<p class='c014'>National President—Mr. Moorfield
Storey, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chairman of the Executive Committee—Mr.
Wm. English Walling, New
York.</p>

<p class='c014'>Treasurer—Mr. John E. Milholland,
New York.</p>

<p class='c014'>Disbursing Treasurer—Mr. Oswald Garrison

<p class='c012'>COMMITTEE.—Our work is carried

<h3 class='c018'>POLITICAL.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Objections to the proposed appointment
of William R. Lewis, a Negro attorney of
Boston, as an assistant attorney-general
are being presented to Attorney-General
Wickersham. President Taft’s intention to
appoint Lewis was learned semi-officially
at the White House several weeks ago.
Booker T. Washington has called upon Mr.
Wickersham to urge his approval of the
appointment, and Speaker Cannon has opposed
it.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>President Taft said in his message: “I
renew my recommendation that the claims
of the depositors in the Freedman’s Bank
be recognized and paid by the passage of
the pending bill on that subject. I also
renew my recommendation that steps be
taken looking to the holding of a Negro
exposition in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the issuing by Mr. Lincoln of
the Emancipation Proclamation.”</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>There is only one feature of the apportionment
matter which is apt to precipitate
trouble, and that is the proposal to reduce
the representation of the Southern States
which have deprived a part of their population
of the right of suffrage. Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina
and other Commonwealths below the
Mason and Dixon line have imposed restrictions
upon the Negroes which make it
impossible for them to vote at any election.—Denver
Times.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE COURTS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>In Richmond, Va., Judge Goff, in the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals,
decided that no deed conveying real
estate could legally preclude the subsequent
conveyance of any part of that real estate
to persons of African descent. He held that
any provision or clause providing that real
estate shall not be acquired by Negroes is
invalid and void, and that no such provision
can be put into a deed. The case was argued
for the Negroes by George J. Hooper
and William L. Royall. A. O. Boschen
argued for the other side. The decision of
Judge Goff will be appealed to the Supreme
Court of the United States. It is
attracting wide attention and much comment
among members of the local bar. The
case was that of the People’s Pleasure Park
vs. Worsham.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Having been defeated in the Supreme
Court of New York, and that defeat having
been affirmed by the Appellate Division,
the colored Order of Elks has filed an
appeal to the Court of Appeals and has
filed a bond of the National Surety Company
to cover the payment of any costs
that may be awarded against it. The colored
order was enjoined from using the
name or the emblem of the white Order
of Elks.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The verdict of $1,000 awarded George
W. Griffin, a Pullman car porter, against
Daniel L. Brady, brother of “Diamond
Jim” Brady, was affirmed by the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court. Griffin
was arrested by Brady on a charge of
theft, and after proving his innocence sued
his accuser.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Joseph Atwater, an Oklahoma Negro,
filed in the Supreme Court of the United
States at Washington his appeal from the
decision of the Oklahoma courts which had
refused to enjoin election officials in Oklahoma
City from denying him the right to
vote on Nov. 8th. The petition for injunction
was based on the claim that the
“grandfather clause” placed in the Oklahoma
constitution by amendment was invalid,
because it would deny the right to
vote to a large number of Negroes in the
State entirely on account of color or previous
condition of servitude.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>SOCIAL UPLIFT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>In New Orleans during the past year
several drug stores have been opened, a
Business League organized, the Pythian
Temple finished, five churches erected and
400 teachers have attended summer normal
schools.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Cyrus Townsend Brady, by a startling
paper read before the Ministers’ Alliance
at a meeting at the Y. M. C. A.,
awakened the ministers into a realization
of the Negro problem, and for the first
time in the history of Kansas City a movement
was organized by the ministers to investigate
and endeavor to better the condition
of the blacks.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The highest average that has been made
on the punching machine in the Census
Office was attained by Miss Eva B. Price,
a colored girl, during the last two weeks
in October. The work on these machines is
done on the piece basis, and during this
period Miss Price earned $88. The highest
up to this time that had been paid any
clerk on this work during any two weeks
was $85. There are about 500 clerks working
on the punching machines, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>considered very high for a clerk to punch
as many as 3,000 cards in one day. Miss
Price’s highest mark for one day was
4,200 cards. She accomplished this unusual
average during the regular seven-hour day,
and has never worked on extra time.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>In Philadelphia prominent churchmen of
several denominations participated in a
conference on the American Negro question,
held in the Central Young Men’s
Christian Association, 1421 Arch Street.
Bishop Mackay-Smith presided, and the
speakers included such leaders in denominational
affairs as the Rev. Dr. Frank P.
Parkin, district superintendent of the Methodist
Episcopal Church; the Rev. Dr. A. J.
Rowland, secretary of the American Baptist
Publication Society; the Rev. Dr. Edwin
Heyl Delk, of St. Matthew’s Lutheran
Church; the Rev. Edwin F. Randolph, of
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church; B.
F. Lee, Jr., of the Armstrong Association,
and James S. Stemons.</p>

<p class='c012'>With the exception of the Bishop, these
ministers and laymen are associated in the
Association for Equalizing Industrial Opportunities,
the purpose of which is to
secure fair play for the Negro wage earner
in the industrial world.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>In Cincinnati the last of the $2,000 needed
to start an institution for colored women
similar to the Y. W. C. A. has been received
by Miss Elma C. Leach, of the Elizabeth
Gamble Deaconess Association, and
the work will be prosecuted at once. The
home will be opened on West Sixth Street,
near Mound. Temporary quarters will
there be provided for colored girls coming
into the city for work and for girls who
are found to be living in undesirable environments.
A nursery will be established
and theoretical nursing taught. Lectures
will also be given.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>In a report the State Inspector of Asylums
of Kentucky says that the buildings
in which the Negro patients at the Eastern
Kentucky Asylum are confined are a disgrace
to the State. One is a cottage
with basement and one story above. This
building, he states, is in a very dangerous
condition, likely to collapse at any time.
It is simply held up with props put under
it from time to time, and should a heavy
wind strike it, it probably would collapse.
In this building there are forty-two colored
female patients. In the other colored ward
building, which has a basement and two
stories, the conditions are equally as bad.
Both male and female patients are confined
in this building, but are kept separate and
distinct. The female capacity is thirty-two—there
are forty-one patients; the male
capacity is seventy—there are eighty-eight
patients. So crowded is the building that
a great number are compelled to sleep in
the basement, which is very dark and damp
and in rainy weather water collects therein.
The inspector states that neither the Board
of Control nor the officers of this institution
are to blame, for they are doing
everything in their power to avert a disaster.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>COLORED COLLEGES.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Howard University at Washington, D. C.,
has this year 1,350 students. The college
students number 347, of whom 167 are
freshmen. Requirements have been raised
both for admission to the college and medical
school. The faculties include 110 professors,
instructors and officers. The endowment
amounts to $281,000. The medical
school has received $55,000 in cash for
tuition fees during the last two years. A
new Carnegie library and hall of applied
science have recently been added to the
plant, and also a steam-heating plant.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Lincoln University, Chester County, Pa.,
has 136 students in the college and 50 in
the theological seminary; all of these are
taught by twelve professors and three instructors.
The grounds and buildings are
worth $250,000, and the endowment is a
little over $600,000. Lately an electric
plant has been added, and a new pipe organ.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Virginia Union University has 35 students
in the college and 30 in the theological
department, 120 in the academy and 40
in the grades. There are sixteen instructors.
A special attempt is being made to
get a new dormitory.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Wilberforce University has issued a
statement which says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Though our existence was threatened in
the past by poverty, war and fire, yet we
have passed from a school with 52 acres of
land, one building, a few small cottages, a
primary department of instruction, two
teachers and a handful of students, to three
large united schools in operation to-day,
aside from the military department. These
are the college, the theological, and the
normal and industrial schools, instructing
in the following courses of study: Classical,
scientific, academic, theological, music,
English preparatory, military, art, business,
sewing, carpentry, printing, cooking, shoemaking,
blacksmithing, wheelwrighting,
brickmaking and bricklaying, plumbing,
tailoring, and applied mechanics and millinery.
It has 350 acres of the best land in
Ohio. It has now ten brick buildings, including
four large halls, a $60,000 trades
building, and a library costing $18,000, the
gift of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The value
of the entire plant, with equipment, is quite
$350,000. There are 32 teachers and an
average of 400 students, and we could have
over one thousand if we had accommodations
for them.”</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Mr. W. A. Joiner, formerly of Howard
University, is superintendent of the State
Department at Wilberforce.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Atlanta University has 400 students enrolled.
Fifty of these are in the college
course, with 30 teachers and officers. There
are 653 normal and college graduates. The
plant consists of seven brick buildings, including
a library worth about $300,000; the
endowment is $75,000, and a special effort
is being made to raise $60,000 this year.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Shaw University, Raleigh, N. C., has
over 500 students enrolled, and applicants
have been turned away. There are preparatory,
normal and college departments, and
classes in theology, medicine and law.
Attention is also given to music and industries.
The Leonard medical building has
been enlarged and a hospital is being built;
shower baths have been put into the gymnasium
and other buildings enlarged. President
Meserve is just completing his seventeenth
year of service.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The Georgia State Industrial College is
near Savannah, Ga. It has 86 acres and
468 students. The school curriculum includes
literary and industrial work. Each
student has to take a trade along with his
other studies. The school depends entirely
upon income from the Landscript
and Morrill funds. Among its outside
activities are farmers’ conferences and an
annual State fair.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class='c019'>In South Carolina Governor-elect Cole
L. Bleaze is opposed to the division of the
educational fund of the State of South
Carolina between schools for the Negroes
and the white children. It became known
lately that the future Governor is convinced
that it would be good for the State
if the educational fund is divided so that
taxes paid by whites for educational purposes
go for the education of white children,
and that those paid by blacks be used
for the education of Negroes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am firmly convinced, after the most
careful thought and study,” said Colonel
Bleaze to-day, “that the Almighty created
the Negro to be a hewer of wood and
drawer of water. I also believe that the
greatest mistake the white race has ever
made was in attempting to educate the free
Negro.”</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The first report of the Louisiana Department
of Education for the year ending
July 1, 1910, shows that the total amount
spent for the maintenance of the public
schools by the State was $4,936,300.64. Of
this amount colored teachers received in
salaries $202,251.13, while white teachers
received $2,404,062.54. There are 5,001
white teachers employed and 1,285 colored
teachers. White male teachers received an
average monthly salary of $75.29, and
white female teachers received an average
monthly salary of $50.80. The average
monthly salary of colored male teachers
was only $34.25, and of colored female
teachers $28.67. The average length of
session of colored elementary schools is
4.6 months. The average lengths of session
of white elementary and high schools
is 8.23 months. There are 9,771 whites enrolled
in the high schools. No figures are
given for colored students enrolled in high
schools. There are 54,637 colored children
attending elementary schools, and 128,022
white children; 75.9 per cent. of white
educable children are enrolled, and only
45.3 per cent. of the colored children. The
average monthly cost of each child based
on average attendance, white $2.90, colored
$1.21.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The colored people of Plateau have the
credit of being the leading Negro settlement
in Mobile County, Alabama, in respect
to raising money to help educate
their children. The patrons of the school
have raised over $180 for their school this
year, $144 of this money being raised
Thanksgiving Day. They are buying a
beautiful site for a high school at a cost of
$900. Over $600 of this money has been
raised, and they are struggling to finish it
this present school term.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>That a systematic and organized crusade
on idleness among members of the colored
race is to be continued was indicated at
the meeting of the Texas Negro Law and
Order League at Houston, Texas. In a
forceful address calling the attention of
the members of the league to many vital
questions affecting the welfare of the race
President John M. Atkins stated that the
time was ripe for sending literature over
the country urging all Negro parents to
look to the moral training of their boys.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>For the purpose of urging every colored
resident of New Orleans to contribute $1
per annum to be used in educating Negro
children, a poll tax association among the
colored people has been formed. A meeting
was held Wednesday night and a citywide
campaign with this object in view
was planned. Circulars will be printed,
stating the reasons for the movement, and
the leaders of every Negro organization in
the city will be asked to prevail upon his
respective membership to see that they pay
their poll tax.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Strong addresses were delivered before
the Mississippi Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church by Professor D. C.
Potts, president of the Mississippi Industrial
College, and Dr. F. M. Williams of
the North Mississippi Conference. Professor
Potts gave a detailed report of the
work done at the institution and declared
that the enrollment at this time of the year

<p class='c019'>There are now five Negro priests in the

<p class='c012'>On Sunday afternoon, October 30, the
societies of the Holy Name of the Roman
Catholic Church made a big demonstration
in Washington, D. C. One feature of it
was the parade, with several thousand in
line, including delegations from Baltimore
and other nearby places. There were many
colored men in line, but there was no semblance
of “jim crowing.” Each marched
with his own parish members of whatever
color. There was a full share of colored
mounted marshals and two of the six
bands were colored, but the colored bands
were not leading colored contingents.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was in striking contrast to the action
of the local committee of the World’s
Sunday School Congress here last May,
which barred the few colored delegates
from the parade altogether, while in other
places they were segregated as far as possible.</p>

The “freedmen” were allowed to select
enough land to bring their allotments up to
forty acres, paying for it the appraised
value of the land. This appraisement was
made by the government several years ago,
and is about one-fourth of the actual cash
value of the land now. The Negroes were
given this preferential right to buy by a
special act of Congress and their right expired
December 1, which caused the rush.</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>OPINION</h2>
</div>

</div>
<h3 class='c018'>THE APPEAL TO EUROPE.</h3>

<p class='c019'>On October 26 a statement and appeal
was sent to Europe signed by thirty-two
Negro Americans. The appeal was not
sent out by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, nor
did the association stand sponsor for it.
It was sent solely on the authority of the
men who signed it. These men include two
editors, one dentist, seven lawyers, two
ministers, two bishops, three physicians, one
teacher, two presidents of educational institutions,
one member of a Legislature and
others.</p>

<p class='c012'>This appeal, after stating that its signers
do not agree with Mr. Washington’s picture
of conditions here, states the following
grievances:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our people were emancipated in a whirl
of passion, and then left naked to the mercies
of their enraged and impoverished ex-masters.
As our sole means of defense we
were given the ballot, and we used it so as
to secure the real fruits of the war. Without
it we would have returned to slavery;
with it we struggled toward freedom. No
sooner, however, had we rid ourselves of
nearly two-thirds of our illiteracy and accumulated
$600,000,000 worth of property
in a generation, than this ballot, which had
become increasingly necessary to the defense
of our civil and property rights, was
taken from us by force and fraud.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To-day in eight States where the bulk
of the Negroes live, black men of property
and university training can be, and usually
are, by law denied the ballot, while the
most ignorant white man votes. This attempt
to put the personal and property
rights of the best of the blacks at the absolute
political mercy of the worst of the
whites is spreading each day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Along with this has gone a systematic
attempt to curtail the education of the black
race. Under a widely advertised system of
‘universal’ education, not one black boy in
three to-day has in the United States a
chance to learn to read and write. The
proportion of school funds due to black
children are often spent on whites, and
the burden on private charity to support
education, which is a public duty, has become
almost intolerable.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In every walk of life we meet discrimination,
based solely on race and color, but
continually and persistently misrepresented
to the world as the natural difference due
to condition.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are, for instance, usually forced to
live in the worst quarters, and our consequent
death rate is noted as a race trait,
and reason for further discrimination.
When we seek to buy property in better
quarters we are sometimes in danger of
mob violence or, as now in Baltimore, of
actual legislation to prevent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are forced to take lower wages for
equal work, and our standard of living is
then criticised. Fully half the labor unions
refuse us admittance, and then claim that
as ‘scabs’ we lower the price of labor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A persistent caste proscription seeks to
force us and confine us to menial occupations
where the conditions of work are
worst.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our women in the South are without
protection in law and custom, and are then
derided as lewd. A widespread system of
deliberate public insult is customary, which
makes it difficult, if not impossible, to secure
decent accommodation in hotels, railway
trains, restaurants and theatres, and
even in the Christian church we are in
most cases given to understand that we are
unwelcome unless segregated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Worse than all this is the wilful miscarriage
of justice in the courts. Not only
have 2,500 black men been lynched publicly
by mobs in the last twenty-five years, without
semblance or pretense of trial, but regularly
every day throughout the South the
machinery of the courts is used, not to prevent
crime and correct the wayward among
the Negroes, but to wreak public dislike and
vengeance and to raise public funds. This
dealing in crime as a means of public revenue
is a system well-nigh universal in the
South, and while its glaring brutality
through private lease has been checked, the
underlying principle is still unchanged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everywhere in the United States the old
democratic doctrine of recognizing fitness
wherever it occurs is losing ground before
a reactionary policy of denying preferment
in political or industrial life to competent
men if they have a trace of Negro blood,
and of using the weapons of public insult
and humiliation to keep such men down.
It is to-day a universal demand in the
South that on all occasions social courtesies
shall be denied any person of known Negro
descent, even to the extent of refusing to
apply the titles of ‘Mr.,’ ‘Mrs.’ or ‘Miss.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Against this dominant tendency, strong
and brave Americans, white and black, are
fighting, but they need, and need sadly, the
moral support of England and of Europe
in this crusade for the recognition of manhood,
despite adventitious differences of
race, and it is like a blow in the face to
have one who himself suffers daily insult
and humiliation in America give the impression
that all is well. It is one thing to
be optimistic, self-forgetful and forgiving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>but it is quite a different thing, consciously
or unconsciously, to misrepresent the
truth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This appeal has provoked widespread
comment all over the world. The Vienna
(Austria) Die Zeit, in publishing the document,
says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“During the sojourn in Vienna of Booker
T. Washington, the distinguished apostle
of the Negro, there appeared in Die Zeit a
report from his pen in which he defended
the white race of North America against
the charge of systematic race prejudice and
pictured the condition of the Negro race as
on the whole very favorable. This report
created great excitement in America and a
deep disagreement among the intelligent
leaders of the American Negroes. Booker
T. Washington was warmly attacked in
many American papers by both white and
black speakers, and finally the American
Negro leaders drew up an outspoken protest
against Washington’s declarations.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Kölnische Volk Zeitung, Germany,
speaks of an article which was “widely
printed in Austria and Germany,” in which
Mr. Washington “expressed himself in very
optimistic words concerning his race in
America and the undoubted solution of the
problem,” and then reprints a part of the
appeal.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the United States the comment has
taken wide range. From the South comes
some bitterness when, for instance, the
Raleigh News and Courier says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is hard to tell which is the worst
enemy of the Negro race—the brute who
invites lynching by the basest of crimes, or
the social-equality-hunting fellow like Du
Bois, who slanders his country. Fortunately
for the peaceable and industrious
Negroes in the South, the world does not
judge them either by Du Bois or the animal,
and helps them and is in sympathy
with their efforts to better their condition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Richmond Leader adds:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Efforts on the part of the Negro to give
practical expression to the dream of equality
may, indeed, cause temporary trouble
and discomfort to the whites, but ultimately
and necessarily they could not fail to provoke
stern repression, and, if necessary,
cruel punishment to the blacks. Fortunately,
the great bulk of the Negro population
in the South realizes this, and, having—at
least for the time—accepted it as inevitable,
they adjust themselves to the subordinate
place to which their race consigns
them, and in which the very existence of the
superior race makes it absolutely necessary
to keep them. There is little friction,
therefore, between them and the white people
among whom they live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chattanooga Times regards the document
as “treasonable incendiarism,” and
many papers denounce it as a demand for
“social equality.” The New Orleans Times-Democrat
says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the average American the most striking
feature is this ‘appeal,’ aside from its
attack upon Booker Washington, is its confession,
virtually in so many words, that
the theory of racial social equality is losing
ground ‘everywhere in the United States.’
Thoughtful students of the American race
problem long ago noted the steady spread
of race instinct, or prejudice, into sections
other than the South; but it was hardly to
be expected that the blatant Negro agitators
would confess that their strident demands
for race equality have not only completely
failed, but have helped to turn the
scale against them. Such progress as the
Negro has made is recorded not by aid of
these aspirants for social equality, but in
spite of them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jersey City Journal says Negroes
can vote in the North, they are educated in
the North, they are only partially restricted
in residence, they usually get equal pay for
equal work, and the “objection to having
colored people in residence sections is natural.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chicago Tribune “can understand
and sympathize” with the signers of the
protest, but points out that the positions
occupied by the signers themselves show
the progress of the Negro.</p>

<p class='c012'>The New York World says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Undeniably, the black population of the
United States has just grievances. So also
has the white population in the United
States. Race prejudice is here as it is in
Europe, and blacks are not the only sufferers.
There is brutal tyranny in industry,
but the blacks are not the only victims.
There are social limitations that are cruel
and inexcusable, but the blacks are not the
only ones against whom the gates are shut.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is a world in which true men give
and take. It is a world in which all must
make allowances. It is a world in which,
after all, men are judged not so much by
race or nationality or possessions as by personal
merit. Otherwise, how could a
Booker Washington, born a Virginia slave,
have ‘stood before kings’ and associated for
the greater part of his life with the earth’s
greatest and best?</p>

<p class='c012'>“We do not condemn the American men
of color who have made this protest. We
simply remonstrate with them. They are
asking more than a white man’s chance, and
in the circumstances that is inadmissible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Boston Globe, however, thinks that
“these and other complaints are backed by
educated Negroes, who demand that the
old world shall know their wrongs. They
deny that Dr. Washington is giving the
right impression of the situation in this
country. It would seem to the average person
that admittedly there is much truth in
the catalog of wrongs the association recites.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Brooklyn Times, too, acknowledges
that “the lot of the colored American is a
hard one at best, but there is nothing to be
gained by complaining over conditions and
prejudices that cannot be altered or eradicated
in the lifetime of a single generation.
There are obstacles in the path of the
Afro-American, even the most intelligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and aspiring, of which the meanest white
man can hardly form an adequate conception;
the only thing the Negro can do is to
make the best of hard conditions and do
his utmost by his individual achievements
to make the handicap of his color forgotten.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not surprising, however, that to
many ambitious colored citizens patience
sometimes ceases to seem a virtue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It adds that the appeal “is a mild statement
of existing conditions. The lot of
the colored American is indeed a hard one.
But it is improving. The area of sweet
reasonableness is being gradually extended.
Old prejudices, and especially racial prejudices,
die hard, as the history of the dispersed
Hebrew nation tells on every page
of the annals of 2,000 years. But prejudice
is not eternal, and every colored American
who does the utmost of his duty in the
place he fills does his part in bringing
about the day when ungenerous and unjust
discrimination will disappear, and when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Man to man, the world o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall brothers be, for a’ that.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Finally, the Buffalo Express says emphatically:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The memorial recites the long and familiar
list of Negro wrongs—the political disfranchisement,
the denial of education in
some States, the discriminations in public
places, the forcing into menial occupations,
the hostility of trades unions, the attempts
to confine Negroes to certain quarters of
towns, the insults to Negro women, etc.
It need not be gone over here. Readers of
the Express are familiar with the shameful
record. The fact that this is an appeal to
the people of Europe against the people of
the United States will arouse fresh antagonism
to the Negro in some quarters, but,
on the whole, it will do good. For shame’s
sake, if not for that of justice, it may
arouse us to do our duty. The opinion of
the civilized world must have some effect
on the most calloused American official conscience.
And it is our governing class, our
men and women of light and leading, that
need to be aroused on this question.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE GHETTO.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The Baltimore attempt to segregate colored
people has called forth widespread
comment. A letter in the New York Sun
thus portrays conditions:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Negro invasion in Baltimore is
principally in a north and northwesterly
direction, comprising the most beautiful,
most exclusive and most valuable residential
sections. About the year 1885 steadily
but insidiously the Negro began to invade
white residential sections. In Pennsylvania
Avenue, beginning at Franklin Street
in the downtown district and running north
about twenty-six blocks to the intersection
of North Avenue and Druid Hill Avenue,
beginning at Paca Street in the downtown
district and running north about twenty
blocks to the intersection of North Avenue,
as well as all blocks lying between Pennsylvania
and Druid Hill Avenues and containing
substantially built three-story
houses, are now in the exclusive possession
of the Negroes. They are now beginning
to invade McCulloh Street, Madison Avenue,
Eutaw Place and Linden Avenue,
which run parallel with Pennsylvania and
Druid Hill Avenues.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Some papers see in this indubitable evidence
of the rise of colored people.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the Fitchburg (Mass.) Sentinel
puts it:</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is one of the most hopeful situations
regarding the Negro which has been
painted. It is enough to send shivers down
the backs of the people who believe that
‘Cursed by Canaan’ is to hold good for all
time. But it is an immense reassurance to
those who are looking for the uplift of the
black race. It seems, from this picture,
that they must be getting rich rapidly.
They are obtaining possession of fine residential
property. They want to live in fine
houses, the same as white folks with
money. Doubtless, too, the same as white
folks, they want to have the good things
which money will buy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Judged by any test other than color,
they seem to be very desirable citizens.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Other papers, like the Bridgeport Telegram,
scent danger:</p>

<p class='c012'>“If they are deprived of the right to
build homes where they please which is
accorded to the most degraded white man
who lands upon these shores provided people
will sell land to him, and robbed of the
right to become skilled workmen, their situation
will be a much graver one than that
from which the Civil War delivered them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Henry Moskowitz, in the New York
Evening Post, points to the Russian analogy
and the Boston Globe also insists on the
failure of the Ghetto idea:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Segregation has never been a very successful
solution of the race problem, as
may be seen in the experience of European
cities with ghettos and in Russia’s
attempt to keep Jews confined within certain
pales. The Baltimore city council,
however, by a piece of special pleading in
its report, tries to justify the ordinance by
saying that its ‘underlying purpose is the
maintenance of peace and good order and
the avoidance of friction and irritation between
the two races.’ The ordinance ‘aims
to prevent the whites from becoming a disturbing
element to the blacks and likewise
to prevent the Negroes from becoming a
disturbing element to the whites.’ Ahem!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The New York Journal calls the experiment
dangerous:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is true that the establishment of
homes of colored people in neighborhoods
hitherto unfrequented by them causes antagonism
and may produce trouble and disturb
real estate values. But it is also true
that it is dangerous, unjust and unworthy
of this century to revive the obsolete
ghetto system, denying to certain human
beings the right to live where they please
and where they can.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“We suppose that a white man who owns
a house has a legal right to sell it to a
Negro if he pleases. And we suppose that
the highest court in the country will sustain
the right of a colored man to live in his
own home, subject to the tax laws and regulations
of his neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Probably the plan to compel a hundred
thousand colored people in Baltimore to
live all together in one neighborhood could
not legally be enforced.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the legal side of the matter Charles
J. Bonaparte, formerly United States Attorney-General,
says to a Baltimore Sun
reporter:</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have always understood, however, that
it was a lawful use of private property to
sell or rent one’s house for a proper purpose
to an orderly person of whatever race
or color, without regard to the wishes or
the complexion of those who live next door,
and, if this be true, then the well-known
Radecke case, in Forty-ninth Maryland, to
say nothing of other authorities, would
seem to show clearly that if our always
wise Mayor and City Council should undertake
to interfere in such a matter, they
could, and would, be politely advised to
mind their own business.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Brooklyn Eagle, the Nyack (N. Y.)
Star and the Dover (N. H.) Democrat call
attention to the Lee Sing case (43 Federal
Reports, 359), which voided an ordinance
restricting the residence of a Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c012'>The New York Sun says on the “property
values” issue:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Baltimore ordinance cannot be supported
on the ground that it is intended to
protect one race against the indignities invariably
experienced whenever it is compelled
to force its presence upon another
race in the pursuit of education, business
and pleasure or in the exercise of political
rights. Its frank purpose is to protect the
property interests of the stronger race. In
the opinion of the City Council of Baltimore
real estate values in certain avenues
have depreciated 30 to 50 per cent. owing
to the presence of Negro residents, but if
the sapient council were to study the recent
census showing of Baltimore it would
no doubt find that other causes have been
at work in bringing about the depreciation.
In any event, the proposed ordinance involves
a principle which the courts are not
likely to accept.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Manchester (N. H.) Union says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would seem as if the Negroes themselves
would tire of making purchases
which immediately sink in value from a
third to one-half, and it is somewhat peculiar
that in Philadelphia and Washington
there has been no tendency to anything of
the kind, either as to encroachment upon
the territory of the whites or a depreciation
of the property occupied by the
Negroes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Macon (Ga.) Telegraph sees a
chance for the Negro to make money
through such segregation and to be proud
of their Ghettos, but the Southwestern
Christian Advocate, a colored paper, says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is almost certain that wherever there
is a Negro quarter there will be little or no
city improvement. Notwithstanding Negroes
pay the same rate of taxes, the
streets on which they live are seldom
paved, poorly lighted, and any public improvements
that might be made are always
last in coming to them. Thousands of
Negroes make an effort not to buy within
the white district but so near that district
that they may be able to get some of the
city improvements. There is also a measure
of protection as well as a measure of
convenience when Negroes live on the better
streets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Negro has a just protest against
the sort of treatment he is forced to endure
notwithstanding he is a taxpayer. It
may be alleged that he is not a heavy taxpayer,
and this we grant, but there are
sections of cities sparsely settled which are
improved at the behest of speculators while
Negro residents are compelled to live in
discomfiture and inconvenience because of
the lack of improvement.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Hughes of Baltimore, speaking for
colored citizens, said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“It means the stopping of self-respecting,
law-abiding colored citizens in their efforts
to secure homes and plant themselves in
communities as taxpayers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rental values will advance since there
will be no outlet for an already congested
population: they must stay where they are,
and in order to do so pay any price which
an unscrupulous money grabber may demand.
With the high cost of foodstuffs
and the low scale of wages for unskilled
labor the passage of the West ordinance
points to the creation of a pauper element
in our city rather than a thrifty, law-abiding
colored citizenship, and the pauper element
of any city or community makes the
more prosperous pay in one way or another
for their support.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In your ordinance you involve the bread
of my people. Recently I stood in Pierce
Street and overheard this conversation:
A colored woman was asked, ‘Did you get
the place?’ ‘Yes, I got it and started to
work, when the lady asked me where I
lived, and when I told her she said she
could not have any one in her house who
came from that street. She said there was
too much disease there.’ It remained for
that woman to move. With the West
ordinance in force, where could she go?
We have already a crowded colored population.
For her to move out meant for
some one else to move in. It affects not
only the employed, but the employer, and
the only way out is for the man who hires
a servant to go to the additional expense
of renting or buying a house for his servants
in more healthy quarters, which will
aggravate the already troublesome help
problem.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Philadelphia Ledger adds helplessly:</p>

<p class='c012'>“How the Negro is going to be helped
to rise under these circumstances is one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the inscrutable problems of our time and
generation. His own unaided efforts are
blocked everywhere by caste restrictions
and discriminations.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The New York Globe says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Negro has been told to smile and
look pleasant as his political rights have
been taken from him. The argument has
been that if he did not make a fuss over
voting the race prejudice of his white fellow
citizen would abate—that he would be
given a freer chance to work, to acquire
property, to become of material weight in
the community. But, North as well as
South, doors of industry are being shut
against the Negro. The economic tragedy
of the educated Negro who aspires to good
things is pitiful. He finds either that personal
effort and merit do not count, or that
they do not count much. In many places
it is against the Negro who is not willing
to stay down in the mire that antipathy
blazes the most brightly. He is the ‘biggotty
nigger’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally the Boston Herald pauses to remark:</p>

<p class='c012'>“We purchased more than we knew with
that first cargo of slaves sold by the Dutch
captain to the Virginia planters now almost
three hundred years ago.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>GOMPERS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>It seems pretty certain that Samuel Gompers,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, was to some extent misquoted
on the Negro problem. The official version
given by Mr. Charles Stetzle is as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The race problem came up in the convention,
but not altogether by the choice of
the delegates. President Gompers had
given an address on the depressed races,
remarking that it could not be expected
that the Negro, for instance, could have as
high an ideal for himself as the Caucasian.
A morning newspaper came out next morning
and in big headlines said that Gompers
had ‘read the Negro out of the trades
union,’ when, as a matter of fact, Gompers
meant exactly the opposite. He took occasion
to correct the erroneous impression
which had been made upon the public. At
any rate, he spoke of it at least three different
times in public addresses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The incident has caused much comment,
most of it based on the supposition that
union labor is officially drawing the color
line. The Chicago Post says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The American Federation of Labor has
always declared that ‘the working people
must unite and organize, irrespective of
creed, color, sex, nationality or politics.’
For many years the Federation denied
membership to all unions which drew the
color line—a stand which kept out, for example,
the International Association of
Machinists until it eliminated the word
‘white’ from its constitution. Even when
the A. F. of L. relented sufficiently to admit
several of the railroad brotherhoods which
were closed to Negroes, Mr. Gompers was
always very robust in his assertion that
organized labor welcomed the Negro
worker. When the Industrial Commission
of 1900 quizzed Mr. Gompers on the race
issue, it drew from him some very touching
stories of Negro loyalty to the trade
union movement. He talked pretty much
like an abolitionist up to a few years
ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Chicago Daily News says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Gompers was represented in the original
report of his address to have dealt
with Negroes and Asiatics as if the problems
presented by the two were similar.
Everybody should know that they are not.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Negroes are native-born American
citizens. They know no other land.
It is their sincere desire, according to the
measure of their abilities, to share in the
life of the American people. They are
making progress in education and industry.
Under these conditions, to deny to Negroes
the right to join labor unions when they
meet the standards required of white applicants
for membership would be clearly
un-American.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The comments of two other papers are
characteristic. The Charleston (S. C.)
News and Courier is complacent:</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no use to palaver about and
invent reasons. Everybody who knows
anything at all knows that racial antipathy
is a real thing, even though intangible.
Why beat about the bush and deny it?
Aside from the ignorance of the Negro, his
many weaknesses, his fatal physiological
structure, his extraction prevents his recognition
as a social equal, be he in South
Africa, America or anywhere else. On that
ground his elimination from white unions
is a necessity. Concomitant reasons need
not be given. They follow in natural sequence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The New York Evening Post says, however:</p>

<p class='c012'>“But even should a reactionary policy of
rigid exclusion prevail, it cannot keep the
Negro down industrially; it will doubtless
handicap him in many sections, but the only
people who can keep the Negroes in an
inferior economic and social position are
the Negroes themselves. A race that has
risen so rapidly against such wonderful
odds is to be held back by no organization
of workingmen, however powerful.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>“COLORED.”</h3>

<p class='c019'>The case of the child with one-sixteenth
Negro blood whom the District of Columbia
courts call a “Negro” has brought some
comment. The Detroit News says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eventually the courts must draw the
line. The dark races when intimately associated
with the white in overpowering numbers
gradually bleach out. At the fourth
remove the descendants are often blond in
type. As the court seems to take no account
of the actual color of the individual
in applying the classification ‘colored,’ it
must be assumed that definition must depend
upon simple mathematics.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The Taunton Gazette adds:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the same reasoning a man with one-sixteenth
Chinese blood is a Chinaman and
one-sixteenth of the blood of any race
relegates him to that race. As a matter of
fact, that question of one-sixteenth is not
likely to arise in any case save where it is
desired to make out a person a Negro, and
that is where the nub of the whole matter
rests.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is probable that there are thousands
of persons in this country with one-sixteenth
Negro blood in them who do not
know it themselves nor does any one else,
for family records are not always carefully
kept along these lines.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>VOTING.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The Boston Transcript has this letter
from Dr. Horace Bumstead:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dr. Doremus Scudder of Hawaii told
the American Missionary Association in
Tremont Temple that the American Negro
of the future will thank his Southern white
brother for depriving him of the ballot until
he should have proved his fitness for it—and
that he would thank him notwithstanding
the manner in which his ballot had
been taken away. Let us see just what this
means.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It means that the Negro will hereafter
be grateful for a disfranchisement practically
based on color rather than unfitness—which
its promoters have boldly avowed
was intended to disfranchise every Negro
if possible and not one white man if it
could be avoided, and which they accomplished
through ‘grandfather’ and ‘understanding’
clauses artfully devised to deprive
the Negro of his constitutional guarantees
for a square deal as regards suffrage
qualifications.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It means that the Negro will hereafter
be grateful for a disfranchisement which
is seriously restricting his economic freedom
and opportunity, the protection of his
life and property, his right to travel in
equal comfort for an equal fare, the education
of his children, and the guarding of
the virtue of his wife and daughters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This conclusion Dr. Scudder naively
states he has arrived at after seven years’
residence, not in the South, but in Hawaii,
and because the liquor dealers there have
bought up the votes of the natives. In
other words, when white men have so little
control over their baser element that they
cannot keep them from offering bribes, the
proper course, in Dr. Scudder’s opinion,
seems to be to take the ballot from all colored
men because some of them have accepted
bribes, rather than to disfranchise
the few white men who have offered them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When American Negroes become grateful
for a disfranchisement accomplished in
such ways, and on such grounds, and with
such detriment to their own welfare, they
will have proved themselves unworthy of
American citizenship. And that time will
never come. They are willing to play the
political game with their white brothers on
equal terms, but not with loaded dice and
marked cards.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>NEGRO SOLDIERS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The Boston Herald reports General
Burt’s views on Negro soldiers as follows:</p>

<p class='c012'>“That in the five qualifications that go to
make up a good soldier, drilling, marksmanship,
marching, discipline and fighting,
the Negro soldiers of the United States
army are paramount, was the contention of
Brigadier-General Andrew S. Burt, retired,
ex-commander of the Brownsville Black
Battalion, in his address last night on ‘The
Negro Soldier in Ancient and Modern
Warfare,’ at a meeting of colored people
in St. Paul’s Baptist Church, under the
auspices of the Boston Literary Association.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He cited two instances in the Spanish-American
War when the colored troops
showed their true value as soldiers. The
first instance being the rescue of the Rough
Riders by the Tenth Colored Cavalry, the
second the heroism of the Twenty-fourth
Colored Infantry in volunteering as nurses
during the yellow fever epidemic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In speaking of army discipline he referred
the audience to his sworn testimony
before the Senate committee on the
Brownsville ‘shoot-up,’ and challenged the
comparison of any records of any class of
good citizens to equal that of the Twenty-fifth
colored regiment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speaking of the Negro soldier generally,
he said: ‘I can find nowhere in the histories
of the Revolutionary, the Indian, the
Spanish-American or the war in the Philippines,
a single instance where a Negro
regiment showed the white feather or refused
to charge the enemy when called to
do so.’”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The A. P. O., of Cape Town, South
Africa, a colored periodical, brings word
of the appointment of Mr. Hull, a colored
man, to the South African cabinet. It
will be remembered that the South African
Constitution requires cabinet members to
be “persons of European descent.” Apparently
men of mixed descent are not excluded.
A. P. O. says:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The decision of General Botha not to relinquish
the premiership, and of Mr. Hull to
accept a seat, and so retain the post of
Treasurer-General, keep the Botha Ministry
practically intact. We predicted that
the Prime Minister would get over his
defeat and cling to his office with its
£4,000 a year.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is now safe to say that we are already
on the road toward a Native Parliament,
which, according to Dr. Broon, is only one
hundred years off; for not only have many
of the present M.L.A.’s an infusion of
native blood in their veins, as is evidenced
by their features, but the very Cabinet contains
colored men. After all, we are moving
pretty fast toward the realization of a
native Government.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The prophecy of Professor Broon, to
which A. P. O. refers, is thus described
in the Tsalo Ea Becoana:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Prof. R. Broon, lecturing recently in
Johannesburg on ‘South Africa 100 Years
Hence,’ made some curious and interesting
statements. He said he had gone into the
question and was thoroughly convinced that
the black man, if the present policy was
continued, was going to rule South Africa
in 100 years. He did not include the
colored people in his meaning, but he referred
to the Kafir or Bantu race. There
were some 1,200,000 white people in South
Africa, while there were 7,200,000 Kafirs.
One of the principal factors that was
welding the natives together was religion.
More and more black labor was being employed
in the Cape Colony, and in a short
time the native would have a large number
of trades in his hands. Intermarriage
between natives and whites was taking
place in Cape Colony. The segregation
policy seemed to be the most practical way
of saving South Africa for the whites.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c017'>A WINTER PILGRIMAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The race problem is not one problem.
It differs not only in time, but in place.
Therefore I always go to different groups
of colored people in this land with much
of interest and curiosity, knowing that each
will present its peculiar phase of relationship
between the white and colored group.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have just come back from such a journey,
and its scenes and lessons are filling
my thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was Toledo, with its colored group
a little pushed aside and half forgotten in
the onward rush of the growing city till
the group gripped itself and awoke and
said: “We are a part of Toledo—you may
not forget us.” So now slowly comes the
push forward and upward.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Cleveland it is far different—it is not
so much a matter of gaining civic recognition
as men and women—that battle was
fought by worthy men long years ago. It
is the deeper problem of holding the
ground gained; of not letting theatres and
restaurants and hotels inaugurate a new
discrimination which had once disappeared.
This is a difficult battle of the new economic
rise of the Negro; when few
Negroes applied or had money to apply it
was easy to say theoretically, “Live where
you will, go where you please.” But when
a group of black folk growing in power
put a $75,000 church on your corner—that
is a phase of the race problem that hadn’t
struck you before.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between these cities of past and present
lies the mystic city of the future, with its
great cloud walls.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Oberlin there are nearly two thousand
young folk at study and at play. Working
and playing beside them are a hundred
colored boys and girls, and they all walk
on sacred ground, on ground long since
consecrated to racial equality and hatred of
caste and slavery. Yet among these venerable
ideals obtrudes the Present and it,
with all its odd corners, must be builded
into the future city.</p>

<p class='c012'>The present holds not only the problem
of the treatment of ten million black folk
elsewhere, but of the hundred colored boys
and girls right there in Oberlin. It presents
a tremendous moral dilemma to frank
young souls. When these children came
from anti-slavery homes they found it easy
and natural to treat black men as men.
But coming now from a world that thinks
God made a big mistake in ever creating
black folk—coming from such social
teaching, they hesitate. Once in a while a
black student (or rather a yellow one)
may be elected a society, but usually no
desert in character or scholarship avails.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet this fact brings no mental peace or
moral satisfaction. The spirit of democracy
is strong, the influence of the faculty
is righteous, and I came from five hours’
earnest conference with these young folk
with a sense of seeing a mighty battle for
righteousness, and a belief that somehow,
sometime, justice would prevail.</p>

<p class='c012'>But after all it was the men I met that
meant most. Could I introduce them? Let
me see. There was the young lawyer who
burned to awaken a sleeping city to its
duties and rights; there was the brown
physician who is one of the leading surgeons
in the city, and his knife finds no
color line. Then the girl who ran a political
campaign last month had a father who
was director in a white bank and one of
the solid business men of the town. In
their parlor gathered a brown father, a
yellow mother, the white pastor and the
white girl chum—but why should we catalog
the colors of their skins and not those
of their clothes? In Oberlin the chief book
store is “colored,” and the chief paperhanger
and the chief building contractor.
Elsewhere I sat with the man who had
just been elected a member of a leading
white city club and heard how the second
highest mechanic in the Peerless motor
factory wore “the shadowed livery of the
sun.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Therefore, all is well? Therefore, all is
not well. Here are a climbing people. The
hardiest and most talented and the pushing
are literally forcing a way. But
against them and against the ordinary black
man the bonds of medievalism are drawn
and ghettos and sumptuary laws are encompassed
in the color line.</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>EDITORIAL</h2>
</div>

</div>
<h3 class='c018'>ENVY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>It is unfortunate that in the recent
newspaper discussion of an Appeal
to Europe sent out not by this Association
but by a number of colored
men of influence and standing, reference
was constantly made to the lowest
personal motives and seldom to
the arguments presented.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is true that with all peoples, and
especially with a race in the throes of
birth-pain, personal likes and jealousies
play a wretchedly large part. But
it does not follow that they explain all
the struggle and difference of opinion.
It is true that the rise of a man like
Mr. Booker T. Washington to a place
of commanding influence has made
him an object of envy to many narrow
souls. But it does not follow that the
thousands of intelligent people who
differ with Mr. Washington are all
actuated by such motives, or are unable
to distinguish great and vital principles
apart from personal feeling.</p>

<p class='c012'>When, therefore, such differences of
opinion arise, as it is natural and
healthy that they should arise, it is
both wrong and unjust to assume the
motive to be necessarily low. Particularly
is this true when adequate causes
of deep and compelling importance are
openly and honestly given as the cause
of this difference.</p>

<p class='c012'>Are such causes sufficient to sustain
the complainers? That is a matter of
argument, not of innuendo or abuse.
No man and no cause are above the
careful scrutiny and criticism of honest
men, and certainly to-day there is
in the United States a very large field
for argument as to the proper attitude
of colored leaders toward the race
problem.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE TRUTH.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>To the honest seeker for light the
puzzling thing about the Southern
situation is the absolutely
contradictory statements that are often
made concerning conditions. For instance,
the New York Evening Post is
taken to task by the Norfolk (Va.)
Landmark for assuming that Southern
colored men are largely disfranchised.
The Virginia paper says “No
Negro in Virginia can be kept from
voting, provided he measures up to
the same requirements for the exercising
of that right that the white man
must. The laws of the State will protect
him in the right should election
officials deny it him. That Negroes
in this State may freely qualify to
vote is fully attested by the fact that
thousands of them do vote.” Again,
the New Orleans Picayune declares
with regard to the complaint of disfranchisement,
“The arrant and absolute
falsity of the specification in regard
to the ballot is seen in the fact
that every legal bar to the exercise of
the ballot applies to whites and Negroes
alike. Every elector (voter)
must either be able to read and write
or, in case of illiteracy, he must pay
taxes on ordinary assessable property
of the minimum value of $300.
These laws are strictly in accordance
with the requirements of the Constitution
of the United States, and have
been so pronounced by the courts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just so in earlier days before legal
disfranchisement, paper after paper
and orator after orator declared that
the Negro could and did vote without
let or hindrance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Despite this, every intelligent person
in the United States knows that
these statements are false. The
Southern testimony to this is itself
open and convincing. Not only have
we Mr. Tillman’s frank and picturesque
testimony on the past, but to-day
the Richmond (Va.) Leader says
that all is well in Virginia “since we
disfranchised the Negro”; Congressman
Underwood of Alabama says the
Alabama Negro “does not count for
anything politically” in that State; a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>prominent judge on the Mississippi
bench says “The Negroes in Mississippi
do not vote and should not,” and
it is a matter of plain official record
in Louisiana that of over 150,000 Negro
males 21 years of age and over
(of whom nearly 70,000 could read
and write) there were in 1908 only
1,743 registered as voters, and these
were disfranchised by the “White Primary”
system. In the face of these
facts, does it pay deliberately to misrepresent
the truth?</p>

<h3 class='c021'>OPPORTUNITY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>A friend of our Association
writes: “While I heartily approve
of the colored people
being given an opportunity to improve
their condition, I feel that after doing
what I can to help them to earn a living
honorably, they must depend on
their own resources to advance themselves.”
This is the attitude of many
excellent friends of humanity, but it
assumes that if a man is fairly
equipped for earning a living to-day he
will have the opportunity to do so, and
that the paths before him will be open
so as to make the rise of the deserving
possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is precisely because the opportunity
to earn a living, even for those
equipped to do so, is not given to-day
to thousands of colored people in the
United States, that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People exists. It is wrong and
wasteful to do for people what they
can and ought to do for themselves,
but when the doors of opportunity are
so shut in their faces so as to discourage
and keep back the hard-working
and deserving, then action is called for.</p>

<p class='c012'>To-day Negroes may work freely as
menials at low wages; they may work
freely as farm laborers under conditions
of semi-slavery; higher than that
they meet unusual difficulties—the difficulty
of saving capital from low
wages to farm or go into business; the
difficulty of securing admission to the
trades even when competent; the difficulty
of securing protection under the
law and of rearing a family in decency;
the difficulty of educating their
children; the difficulty of protecting
their rights by the ballot. To be sure,
if they are unusually gifted and pushing
they may push higher at the risk
of insult and bitter opposition. Thus
the fact remains that the mass of the
willing, eager workers of the race are
held back and forced down by a deep
and growing race prejudice, and these,
pressing down on the lower strata, encourage
in them laziness and vagrancy
and crime. The National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People
is an organization for giving the
colored race a reasonable opportunity
to help itself.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The philanthropist of a city like
New York is bewildered and
often exasperated by the demands
and begging of colored schools
in the South.</p>

<p class='c012'>To some extent this is inevitable,
and is due to the fact that the United
States is undertaking to give elementary
education to a race of ten million
people very largely by private philanthropy
instead of making this a State
and even a national charge, and leaving
to voluntary effort the college
work and work of social uplift.</p>

<p class='c012'>But beyond this the philanthropic
world is to some extent itself to blame
because of the encouragement it gives
to unknown and unvouched-for enterprises
and to unwise and unjustifiable
attempts to duplicate existing foundations.</p>

<p class='c012'>The representative of a great fund
once called on the writer and expressed
great sorrow that an alleged
school in the South to which one of
the most prominent New York philanthropists
had given $5,000 was
found on investigation to be no school
at all. This was unfortunate, but
there are hundreds of good and deserving
schools starving for help
which this philanthropist did not give
to because their representatives did not
appear so glib or plausible. It is not
the smoothest talker who necessarily
is doing the best work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
<img src='images/i_019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='center'><i>THE NATIONAL PASTIME.</i></span><br>  <br>  <i>Seventy-five per cent. of the Negroes lynched have not even been accused of rape.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Again, indiscriminate and ill-advised
giving encourages such things as are
happening in Atlanta. Atlanta needs
public elementary schools, but it does
not need more private schools. The
existing schools are equipped for excellent
work in industries, agriculture,
college training and some professional
work. With adequate help and endowment
they could do splendid work.</p>

<p class='c012'>Because, however, one man deservedly
lost his job at one of these great
schools, he is attempting to found a
new school in Atlanta and unnecessarily
duplicate this work. Soon he
will appear in New York asking funds,
and without investigation or thought
many will give. When they find their
efforts wasted the deserving schools
will suffer.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is crying need of an impartial,
thoroughly reliable directory of
educational and philanthropic effort
among Negroes, a central information
bureau on broad lines, with maps and
figures at command which could furnish
unbiased facts. The National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People is ready to undertake
such a work immediately on a small
scale, and to expand it whenever it can
get the necessary support.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE OLD STORY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>There is without doubt a large
criminal and semi-criminal class
among colored people. This is
but another way of saying that the
social uplift of a group of freedmen is
a serious task. But it is also true, and
painfully true, that the crime imputed
carelessly and recklessly against colored
people gives an impression of far
greater criminality than the facts warrant.</p>

<p class='c012'>Take, for instance, a typical case:
A little innocent schoolgirl is brutally
murdered in New Jersey. A Negro
vagabond is arrested. Immediately
the news is heralded from East to
West, from North to South, in Europe
and Asia, of the crime of this
black murderer. Immediately a frenzied,
hysterical mob gathers and attempts
to lynch the poor wretch. He
is spirited away and the public is
almost sorry that he has escaped summary
justice. Without counsel or
friends, the man is shut up in prison
and tortured to make him confess.
“They did pretty near everything to
me except kill me,” whispered the
wretched man to the first friend he
saw.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally, after the whole black race
in America had suffered aspersion for
several weeks, sense begins to dawn in
Jersey. After all, what proof was
there against this man? He was lazy,
he had been in jail for alleged theft
from gypsies, he was good natured,
and he drank whiskey. That was all.
Yet he stayed in jail under no charge
and under universal censure. The
coroner’s jury found no evidence to
indict him. Still he lay in jail.
Finally the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People
stepped in and said, “What are you
holding this man for?” The Public
Prosecutor got red in the face and
vociferated. Then he went downtown,
and when the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings
came and the judge asked
again: “Why are you holding this
man?” the prosecutor said chirpily,
“For violating election laws,” and
brought a mass of testimony. Then
the judge discharged the prisoner
from the murder charge and congratulated
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People—but
the man is still in jail.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such justice is outrageous and such
methods disgraceful. Black folk are
willing to shoulder their own sins, but
the difference between a vagabond and
a murderer is too tremendous to be
lightly ignored.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>“SOCIAL EQUALITY.”</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>At last we have a definition of
the very elusive phrase “Social
Equality” as applied to the Negro
problem. In stating their grievances
colored people have recently
specified these points:</p>

<p class='c012'>1. Disfranchisement, even of educated
Negroes.</p>

<p class='c012'>2. Curtailment of common school
training.</p>

<p class='c012'>3. Confinement to “Ghettos.”</p>

<p class='c012'>4. Discrimination in wages.</p>

<p class='c012'>5. Confinement to menial employment.</p>

<p class='c012'>9. Personal discourtesy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Southern papers in Charlotte, Richmond,
New Orleans and Nashville
have with singular unanimity hastened
to call this complaint an unequivocal
demand for “social equality,” and as
such absolutely inadmissible. We are
glad to have a frank definition, because
we have always suspected this
smooth phrase. We recommend on
this showing that hereafter colored
men who hasten to disavow any desire
for “social equality” should carefully
read the above list of disabilities which
social inequality would seem to prescribe.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>ASHAMED.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Any colored man who complains
of the treatment he receives in
America is apt to be faced
sooner or later by the statement that
he is ashamed of his race.</p>

<p class='c012'>The statement usually strikes him
as a most astounding piece of illogical
reasoning, to which a hot reply is appropriate.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet notice the curious logic of
the persons who say such things.
They argue:</p>

<p class='c012'>White men alone are men. This
Negro wants to be a man. <i>Ergo</i> he
wants to be a white man.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their attention is drawn to the
efforts of colored people to be treated
decently. This minor premise therefore
attracts them. But the major
premise—the question as to treating
black men like white men—never enters
their heads, nor can they conceive
it entering the black man’s head. If
he wants to be a man he must want
to be white, and therefore it is with
peculiar complacency that a Tennessee
paper says of a dark champion of
Negro equality: “He bitterly resents
his Negro blood.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Not so, O Blind Man. He bitterly
resents your treatment of Negro
blood. The prouder he is, or has a
right to be, of the blood of his black
fathers, the more doggedly he resists
the attempt to load men of that blood
with ignominy and chains. It is race
pride that fights for freedom; it is the
man ashamed of his blood who weakly
submits and smiles.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>JESUS CHRIST IN BALTIMORE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>It seems that it is not only Property
that is screaming with fright
at the Black Spectre in Baltimore,
but Religion also. Two churches
founded in the name of Him who
“put down the mighty from their seats
and exalted them of low degree” are
compelled to move. Their palatial edifices
filled with marble memorials and
Tiffany windows are quite useless for
the purposes of their religion since
black folk settled next door. Incontinently
they have dropped their Bibles
and gathered up their priestly robes
and fled, after selling their property to
colored people for $125,000 in good,
cold cash.</p>

<p class='c012'>Where are they going? Uptown.
Up to the wealthy and exclusive and
socially select. There they will establish
their little gods again, and learned
prelates with sonorous voices will ask
the echoing pews: “How can the
Church reach the working man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Why not ask the working man?
Why not ask black people, and yellow
people, and poor people, and all the
people from whom such congregations
flee in holy terror? The church that
does not run from the lowly finds the
lowly at its doors, and there are some
such churches in the land, but we fear
that their number in Baltimore is not
as great as should be.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>“EXCEPT SERVANTS.”</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The noticeable reservation in all
attempts, North and South, to
separate black folk and white
is the saving phrase, “Except servants.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Are not servants colored? Is the
objection, then, to colored people or to
colored people who are not servants?
In other words, is this race prejudice
inborn antipathy or a social and economic
caste?</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>SOCIAL CONTROL</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>By JANE ADDAMS, of Hull House</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>I always find it very difficult to
write upon the great race problem
which we have in America.
I think, on the whole, that the most
satisfactory books on the subject are
written by people outside of America.
This is certainly true of two books,
“White Capital and Black Labor,” by
the Governor of Jamaica, and William
Archer’s book entitled “Afro-America.”
Although the latter is inconclusive,
it at least gives one the impression
that the man who has written it
has seen clearly into the situation, and
that, I suppose, is what it is very difficult
for any American to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>One thing, however, is clear to all of
us, that not only in the South, but
everywhere in America, a strong race
antagonism is asserting itself, which
has various modes of lawless and insolent
expression. The contemptuous
attitude of the so-called superior race
toward the inferior results in a social
segregation of each race, and puts the
one race group thus segregated quite
outside the influences of social control
represented by the other. Those inherited
resources of the race embodied
in custom and kindly intercourse
which make much more for social restraint
than does legal enactment itself
are thus made operative only
upon the group which has inherited
them, and the newer group which
needs them most is practically left
without. Thus in every large city we
have a colony of colored people who
have not been brought under social
control, and a majority of the white
people in the same community are
tacitly endeavoring to keep from them
those restraints which can be communicated
only through social intercourse.
One could easily illustrate
this lack of inherited control by comparing
the experiences of a group of
colored girls with those of a group
representing the daughters of Italian
immigrants, or of any other South
European peoples. The Italian girls
very much enjoy the novelty of factory
work, the opportunity to earn money
and to dress as Americans do, but this
new freedom of theirs is carefully
guarded. Their mothers seldom give
them permission to go to a party in
the evening, and never without chaperonage.
Their fathers consider it a
point of honor that their daughters
shall not be alone on the streets after
dark. The daughter of the humblest
Italian receives this care because her
parents are but carrying out social traditions.
A group of colored girls, on
the other hand, are quite without this
protection. If they yield more easily
to the temptations of a city than any
other girls, who shall say how far the
lack of social restraint is responsible
for their downfall? The Italian parents
represent the social traditions
which have been worked out during
centuries of civilization, and which
often become a deterrent to progress
through the very bigotry with which
they cling to them; nevertheless, it is
largely through these customs and
manners that new groups are assimilated
into civilization.</p>

<p class='c012'>Added to this is the fact that a decent
colored family, if it is also poor,
often finds it difficult to rent a house
save one that is undesirable, because
situated near a red-light district, and
the family in the community least
equipped with social tradition is forced
to expose its daughters to the most flagrantly
immoral conditions the community
permits. This is but one of the
many examples of the harmful effects
of race segregation which might be
instanced.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another result of race antagonism
is the readiness to irritation which in
time characterizes the intercourse of
the two races. We stupidly force one
race to demand as a right from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>other those things which should be accorded
as a courtesy, and every meeting
between representatives of the two
races is easily characterized by insolence
and arrogance. To the friction
of city life, and the complications of
modern intercourse, is added this
primitive race animosity which should
long since have been outgrown. When
the white people in a city are tacitly
leagued against the colored people
within its borders, the result is sure to
be disastrous, but there are still
graver dangers in permitting the primitive
instinct to survive and to become
self-assertive. When race antagonism
manifests itself through lynching, it
defiantly insists that it is superior to
all those laws which have been gradually
evolved during thousands of
years, and which form at once the record
and the instrument of civilization.
The fact that this race antagonism enables
the men acting under its impulsion
to justify themselves in their lawlessness
constitutes the great danger
of the situation. The men claim that
they are executing a primitive retribution
which precedes all law, and in
this belief they put themselves in a
position where they cannot be reasoned
with, although this dangerous
manifestation must constantly be reckoned
with as a deterrent to progress
and a menace to orderly living. Moreover,
this race antagonism is very close
to the one thing in human relations
which is uglier than itself, namely, sex
antagonism, and in every defense
made in its behalf an appeal to the latter
antagonism is closely interwoven.
Many men in every community justify
violence when it is committed under
the impulsion of these two antagonisms,
and others carelessly assert
that great laws of human intercourse,
first and foremost founded upon justice
and right relations between man
and man, should thus be disregarded
and destroyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People will
soberly take up every flagrant case of
lawbreaking, and if it allow no withdrawal
of constitutional rights to pass
unchallenged, it will perform a most
useful service to America and for the
advancement of all its citizens. Many
other opportunities may be open in
time to such an association, but is not
this its first and most obvious obligation?</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>Employment of Colored Women in Chicago</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>From a Study Made by the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In considering the field of employment
for colored women, the professional women
must be discussed separately. They admit
fewer difficulties and put a brave face on
the matter, but in any case their present
position was gained only after a long struggle.
The education is the less difficult part.
The great effort is to get the work after
having prepared themselves for it. The
Negro woman, like her white sister, is constantly
forced to choose between a lower
wage or no work. The pity is that her
own people do not know the colored girl
needs their help nor realize how much they
could do for her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two of the musicians found the struggle
too hard and were compelled to leave Chicago.
One girl of twenty-three, a graduate
of the Chicago Conservatory of Music, is
playing in a low concert hall in one of the
worst sections of the city, from 8 in the
evening till 4 in the morning. Her wages
are $18 a week, and with this she supports
a father and mother and younger sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are from fifteen to twenty colored
teachers in the public schools of Chicago.
This information was obtained from the
office of the superintendent, where it was
said no record was kept of the number of
colored teachers. When they are given such
a place they are always warned that they
are likely to have difficulty. As a rule they
are in schools where the majority of the
children are Negroes. They are all in the
grades, but they say that their opportunities
for promotion are equal to those of
white women. Indeed, they say that there
are two places where they are not discriminated
against because of their color. One
is in the public schools, the other is under
the Civil Service Commission.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, the professional women do not
have the greatest difficulty. The real barriers
are met by the women who have had
only an average education—girls who have
finished high school, or perhaps only the
eighth grade. These girls, if they were
white, would find employment at clerical
and office work in Chicago’s department
stores, mail order houses and wholesale
stores. But these positions are absolutely
closed to the Negro girl. She has no
choice but housework.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the object of the inquiry was explained
to one woman she said: “Why, no
one wants a Negro to work for him. I’ll
show you—look in the newspaper.” And
she produced a paper with its columns of
advertisements for help wanted. “See,
not one person in this whole city has asked
for a Negro to work for him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A great many of the colored women find
what they call “day work” most satisfactory.
This means from eight to nine hours
a day at some kind of housework, cleaning,
washing, ironing or dusting. This the
Negro women prefer to regular positions
as maids, because it allows them to go at
night to their families. The majority of
the women who do this work receive $1.50,
with 10 cents extra for carfare. There
was a higher grade of day work for which
the pay was $2 a day besides the carfare.
This included the packing of trunks, washing
of fine linen and lace curtains, and even
some mending.</p>

<p class='c012'>The records of the South Side Free Employment
Agency showed that the wages of
colored women were uniformly lower than
those of white women. Of course, there is
no way of judging of ability by records,
but where the white cooks received $8 per
week the Negro cooks were paid $7, and
where the white maids received $6, sometimes,
but not as frequently as in the case
of the cooks, the Negro maid received less.
One dollar and a half was paid for “day
work.” At the colored employment agency
which is run in connection with the Frederic
Douglas Centre they have many more
requests for maids than they have girls to
fill the places. Good places with high wages
are sometimes offered, but the girls are
more and more demanding “day work” and
refusing to work by the week. At the
South Side Free Employment Agency during
the months of January, February and
March of this year forty-two positions for
colored women were found.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> These forty-two
positions were filled by thirty-six
women, some of them coming back to the
office two or three times during the three
months. The superintendent said it was
difficult to find places for the colored
women who applied, and they probably succeeded
in placing only about 25 per cent. of
them. In the opinion of those finding the
work for the girls in this office, the reason
for the difficulties they encounter are the
fact that they do not remain long in one
place and have a general reputation for
dishonesty. The fundamental cause of the
discrimination by employers against them
is racial prejudice either in the employer
himself or in his customers.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c012'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. 454 white women in the same time.</p>
</div>

<p class='c012'>One girl who has only a trace of colored
blood was able to secure a position as salesgirl
in a store. After she had been there a
long time she asked for an increase in
wages, such as had been allowed the white
girls, but the request was refused and she
was told that she ought to be thankful that
they kept her at all.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In many cases, especially when the
women were living alone, the earnings, plus
the income from the lodgers, barely covered
the rent. When they work by the
day they rarely work more than four days
a week. Sometimes the amount they gave
as their weekly wage fell short of even
paying the rent, but more often the rent
was covered and a very small margin left
to live on.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such treatment has discouraged the
Negro woman. She has accepted the conditions
and seldom makes any real effort to
get into other sorts of work. The twelfth
question on the schedule, “What attempts
have you made to secure other kinds of
work in Chicago or elsewhere?” was usually
answered by a question: “What’s the use
of trying to get work when you know
you can’t get it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colored women are like white women
in the same grade of life. They do not
realize the need of careful training, and
they do not appreciate the advantages of
specialization in their work. But the
Negro woman is especially handicapped, for
she not only lacks training but must overcome
the prejudice against her color. Of
the 270 women interviewed, 43 per cent.
were doing some form of housework for
wages, yet all evidence of conscious training
was entirely lacking. This need must
be brought home to them before they can
expect any real advancement.</p>

<p class='c012'>A peculiar problem presents itself in connection
with the housework. Practically
this is the only occupation open to Negro
women, and it is also the only occupation
where one is not expected to go home at
night. This the Negroes insist on doing.
They are accused of having no family feeling,
yet the fact remains that they will accept
a lower wage and live under far less
advantageous conditions for the sake of
being free at night. That is why the “day
work” is so popular. Rather than live in
some other person’s home and get good
wages for continued service, the colored
woman prefers to live in this way. She will
have a tiny room, go out as many days a
week as she can get places, and pay for her
room and part of her board out of her
earnings, which sometimes amount to only
$3 or $4.50 per week.</p>

<p class='c012'>Occasionally laundry, sewing or hair
work is done in their homes, but the day
work is almost universally preferred.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many of the Negroes are so nearly white
that they can be mistaken for white girls,
in which case they are able to secure very
good positions and keep them as long as
their color is not known.</p>

<p class='c012'>One girl worked for a fellowship at the
Art Institute. Her work was good and the
place was promised her. In making out the
papers she said Negro, when asked her
nationality, to the great astonishment of the
man in charge. He said he would have to
look into the matter, but the girl did not
get the fellowship.</p>

<p class='c012'>A young man, son of a colored minister
in the city, had a position in a business
man’s office, kept the books, collected rents,
etc. He had a peculiar name, and one of
the tenants remembered it in connection
with the boy’s father, who had all the
physical characteristics of the Negro. The
tenant made inquiries and reported the matter
to the landlord, threatening to leave the
building if he had to pay rent to a Negro.
The boy was discharged.</p>

<p class='c012'>A colored girl, who was very light colored,
said that more than once she secured
a place and the colored people themselves
had told the employer he had a “Negro”
working for him. The woman with whom
she was living said: “It’s true every time.
The Negroes are their own worst enemies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To summarize, the isolation which is
forced upon the Negro, both in his social
and his business life, constitutes one of the
principal difficulties which he encounters.
As far as the colored woman is concerned,
as we have shown, the principal occupations
which are open to her are domestic
service and school teaching. This leaves a
large number of women whose education
has given them ambitions beyond housework,
who are not fitted to compete with
northern teachers and yet cannot obtain
clerical work because they are Negroes.
Certain fields in which there is apparently
an opportunity for the colored women are
little tried. For example, sewing is profitable
and there is little feeling against the
employment of Negro seamstresses, and yet
few follow the dressmaking profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without doubt one fundamental reason
for the difficulties the colored woman meets
in seeking employment is her lack of industrial
training. The white woman suffers
from this also, but the colored woman
doubly so. The most hopeful sign is the
growing conviction on the part of the leading
Negro women of the city that there is
need of co-operation between them and the
uneducated and unskilled, and that they are
trying to find some practical means to give
to these women the much-needed training
for industrial life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The policy usually carried out consistently
in the South of refusing the colored
woman the courtesies accorded the white
woman leads to some unfortunate results.
One of the courtesies refused is the title
of “Mrs.” or “Miss.” Thus a Kentucky
newspaper, in its recent educational news,
notes “the resignation of Mrs. Mattie
Spring Barr as a substitute teacher and the
unanimous election of Miss Ella Williams,”
while a few paragraphs below it
says that “Principal Russell of the Russell
Negro School asked that Lizzie Brooks be
promoted to the position of regular
teacher and that Annie B. Jones be made
a substitute.” Here we have two groups of
women doing similar important work for
the community, yet the group with Negro
blood is denied the formality of address
that every other section of the country
gives to the teacher in a public school.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>How much the South loses by this policy
is shown by a Northerner’s experience in
the office of one of the philanthropic societies.
Two probation officers, volunteers,
were going out to their work. The secretary
of the society addressed the first, a
white woman, as Mrs. Brown: the second,
a little middle-aged black woman, he called
Mary. When they had left the Northerner
questioned the difference in address. “I
couldn’t call a nigger Mrs. or Miss.,” the
secretary expostulated. “It would be impossible.”
“But here in your own city,” the
Northerner answered, “I happen to know a
number of educated colored girls, some of
them college graduates, who have a desire
for social service. Under you they might
learn the best methods of charitable work,
but they would not care to be called ‘Annie’
or ‘Jane’ by a young white man. Can you
afford to lose such helpers as these?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He had but one answer. “It would never
do for me to say Mrs. or Miss to a nigger.
It would be impossible.”</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>Throughout the country there are a number
of colored postal clerks. These men,
with others in the service, belong to the
Mutual Benefit Association. At a recent
meeting in Chicago the delegates to this
Mutual Benefit Association voted in the
future to admit only clerks of the Caucasian
race. According to one of the colored
clerks, the meeting that passed this
vote was “packed,” colored members receiving
no notice to elect delegates to it.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>The black servant is more acceptable to
some people than the educated colored man.
As an instance of this is Mr. U. of Washington,
a highly cultivated Negro of some
means. As owner of a cottage and a few
acres of land in a small Virginia town, he
good-naturedly allowed an old black
woman to live rent-free upon his place.
On her death he went down to claim the
property, but found the woman’s daughter
had put in a counter claim. The case went
to court, and in his plea before the jury
the woman’s lawyer said: “Are you going
to take property away from this black
mammy’s daughter to give it to a smart
nigger from Washington?” And despite
Mr. U.’s former yearly payment of taxes,
despite the deed which he himself held, he
lost his suit.</p>

<hr class='c020'>

<p class='c012'>In Wilcox County Ala., there are 10,758
Negro children and 2,000 white children of
school age, making a total population of
12,758. The per capita allowance for each
child in the State this year is $2.56. According
to the recent apportionment of the
school fund on this basis, Wilcox County
receives $32,660.48. Of this amount the
10,758 Negro children have been allowed
one-fifth, or $6,532.09, about 60 cents each,
while the 2,000 white children receive the
remaining four-fifths, or $26,128.39, about
$13 each. Further investigation shows that
only 1,000 of the 10,758 Negro children are
in school, leaving 6,758 with absolutely no
provision for obtaining even a common
school education.</p>

  <h2 class='c017'>TALKS ABOUT WOMEN</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>NUMBER TWO      By Mrs. JOHN E. MILHOLLAND</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A most interesting and instructive morning
was given at the Berkeley Lyceum on
Wednesday, December 7, under the auspices
of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. The
weather was bitterly cold, and although
the great fall of snow during the night
had made getting about a not only troublesome
but dangerous experience, the little
theatre was well filled with many well-known
women in sympathy with the cause
and interested in all sorts of activities for
progress. The chairman, Mr. John Haynes
Holmes, introduced Madame Hackley, who
gave the musical part of the program, and
did it well with her customary finish and
appreciation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Madam Hackley was trained in Paris,
and gave several French selections with
great skill.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, the speaker,
was most enthusiastically received, and
made, as usual, a most effective and touching
speech, to which her audience listened
with not only interest but surprise, as many
present had never dreamed of the struggles
of these women in their efforts for
educational advancement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without doubt Mrs. Terrell is one of the
best orators we have to-day. She has
much dignity, with a very easy and fluent
mode of speaking. She is direct, and
when, as on this occasion, she is talking for
the women of her race, her enthusiasm and
sincerity carry conviction to her listeners.
When she had finished Mrs. Terrell was
warmly congratulated, and the enthusiastic
daughter of the great orator, Robert Ingersoll,
Mrs. Walston R. Brown, declared that
“Mrs. Terrell must tell her story again to
a larger and fuller audience.” In her remarks
Mrs. Terrell told of the obstacles
which confront colored women and girls
in their efforts to better their conditions.
Often having to battle against this great
evil of race prejudice which yet lingers in
our land and which so often stands in the
way of progress for these women, not only,
said Mrs. Terrell, must she struggle with
the handicap of color, but only too often
she gets no sympathy from the white
woman, who should be at least willing to
give a helping hand to these colored friends
who, like herself, are more or less looking
forward to perfect freedom and all which
that means for womanhood. The speaker
thought that right here was a big field for
the American woman’s activities, and hoped
for the co-operation of her white friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stanton Blatch, who was in the
audience, made a short but forceful speech
for the cause of women, and thought “the
vote” would help along quicker than anything
else all reforms of this or any other
nature. The secretary of the Trades
Woman’s League also spoke, and declared
that she would do her part toward opening
the doors of her association to all women,
whether white or colored.</p>

<p class='c012'>After a most delightful rendering of several
Negro melodies, Mrs. Hackley told
how she so much hoped to establish a school
of music for her people. No one hearing
her direct, simple and earnest story doubted
for a moment her ultimate success in this
worthy effort, and she most certainly will
have the co-operation of every musical
member of her audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>The chairman made a few remarks with
his usual dignity and precision, and the first
musical morning was voted a real success.
Those having boxes were Mrs. Villard, Mrs.
E. W. Harkness, Mrs. Paul M. Warburg,
Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Mrs. Robert Ingersoll,
whose daughter, Miss Maud, acted as
one of the ushers; Mrs. Ida Husted Harper,
Mrs. Frederick Nathan, Mrs. Frances R.
Keyser, Mrs. Charles W. Anderson, together
with many other well-known women,
white and colored.</p>

<p class='c012'>The arrangements were in charge of Miss
Frances Blascoer, executive secretary of
the Association.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_027.jpg' alt='Books' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The annual report of British East Africa
for the year 1908–09, which was issued a
few months ago, states that the period was
not marked by any salient events, but the
Protectorate had made steady progress in
spite of weather conditions somewhat unfavorable
to agriculture. There had been
little or no friction with native tribes.
Labor difficulties still exist, but show a
tendency to diminish. European overseers
of the native railway laborers have proved
far more satisfactory than the Indians formerly
employed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The report says of slavery:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ordinance for the abolition of the
legal status of slavery has worked well and
without friction during the year. Altogether
3,593 cases have been settled by
the District Courts, and compensation to
the amount of £7,053 has been awarded.”</p>

<h3 class='c021'>THE LADY OF THE SLAVE STATES.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Mrs. George Haven Putnam, in a very
charming essay in the Contemporary Review
for December, discusses “The Lady
of the Slave States.” She deals gently
enough with her subject; she says that the
slave-owner’s wife like everybody else with
slavery was blighted by its curse, but she
demolished very effectually the myth of
the gracious fascinating woman of culture
who ruled family and estate by the charm
of her personality.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ante-bellum Southern lady never
had much to say for herself and was in
short not “the Gothic saint in her niche”
that tradition pictures, but a kindly little
creature surrounded by “Orientalism” and
little better off, so far as opportunities for
development went, than any lady of the
harem.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Putnam quotes Miss Martineau, who
traveled extensively through the slave
States, to show how the system limited
the white women and made them “the
greatest slaves on the plantation.” Patience
was the supreme virtue of the ante-bellum
lady—they made the best of a bad
state of affairs. Logic she had little or
none, and her up-bringing tended to make
her a delightful girl but a middle-aged
woman of only moderate attractions. And
while she was often very kind to her slaves
her sensibilities seemed in some measure
blunted by perpetual sight of suffering and
injustice.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the war ended the ex-mistresses of
slaves showed how good was the material
that had been buried under the “Orientalism”
of the plantation.</p>

<h3 class='c021'>RACE PREJUDICE IN THE ORIENT.</h3>

<p class='c019'>Race Prejudice: An address by Melville
E. Stone to the Quill Club, New York City.</p>

<p class='c012'>The best review of this remarkable little
pamphlet will be a few extracts from its
pages:</p>

<p class='c012'>What is to be the outcome? What does
all this mean for the future of the world?
Let us view the problem from the political,
the commercial and the moral aspects.
How long will the 6,000 soldiers we have
in the Philippines be able to keep our flag
afloat among 8,000,000 of natives? How
long will the 75,000 English soldiers in
India be able to maintain British sovereignty
over 300,000,000 of Asians? Believe
me, these are not idle questions. They are
up to us for an answer, whether we will or
no, and upon our ability to make answer
will depend the future of what we are
pleased to call our Western civilization. I
would not be an alarmist, and yet I would
have you feel that Macauley’s suggestion of
the New Zealander on a broken arch of
London Bridge, sketching the ruins of St.
Paul, has come to be more than an extravagant
figure of speech. And I am convinced
that there is real danger awaiting
us unless we mend our ways. It is not
the Asian who needs educating; it is the
European. I am not worrying half so
much about the heathen in his blindness as
I am about the Christian in his blindness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Asia is awake and preparing for the coming
struggle. And we are doing very much
to force the issue and to prepare her for
the contest. For a century we have been
sending at enormous cost our missionaries
to all parts of the hemisphere to civilize.
There may be doubt as to the amount of
proselyting we have been able to accomplish;
there can be no possible doubt of the
work we have done to strengthen the
Asian people politically and commercially.</p>

<p class='c012'>We shall never meet the problems growing
out of our relation with the Far East
unless we absolutely and once for all put
away race prejudice. I believe the European
snob in Asia is distinctly the enemy of
the civilized West. And his coadjutor in
this country is a fitting criminal yoke-fellow.
Let me give you some illustrations
of what I mean—cases which came under
my personal observation. From Bombay
to Yokohama there is not a social club at
any port or treaty point where a native,
whatever his culture or refinement, will be
admitted. At the Bengal Club at Calcutta
last year a member in perfectly good standing
innocently invited an Eurasian gentleman—that
is, one who is half native and
half European—to dine with him. It became
known that the invitation had been
extended, and a storm of opposition broke
among the members. The matter was
finally adjusted by setting aside the ladies’
department of the club, and there the offending
member and his unfortunate guest
dined alone. The next day the member
was called before the board of governors
and notified that another like breach of the
rules would result in his expulsion. The
beating of native servants and workmen in
India is a daily and hourly occurrence. It
formerly was so at Hong Kong and Shanghai,
but Mr. Sprague, the representative of
the Standard Oil Company at Shanghai,
told me that since the Russo-Japanese war
the natives would not stand it, and that all
beating of them by Europeans in that city
had ceased.</p>

<p class='c012'>The son of a maharaja goes to England,
is educated at Oxford or Cambridge, is
lionized in the West End of London—mayhap
he is honored with an invitation to
Windsor. When he goes back home he
may enter no white man’s club; if he be
fortunate enough to be invited to a white
man’s function, no white woman will dance
or associate with him; and if by any luck
he should marry a European, he, his wife
and his children become outcasts. Although
native troops, like the Sikhs, have
shown undying loyalty to the British flag
and on frequent occasions have exhibited
courage in the highest degree, no one of
them ever has or ever can achieve the Victoria
Cross.</p>

<p class='c012'>Socially they are all saying to us: “Stop
cheating us, stop swindling us, stop your
treating us as your inferiors who are to be
beaten and robbed.” Japan is crying out,
“Treat us fairly and we will go more than
half-way. Leave to us the question
whether Japanese laborers shall go to
America to annoy you, and we will stop
them. But do not say that you will admit
the lazaroni of Hungary and Italy and
Russia, simply because they are white, and
shut us out because we are yellow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Sinhalese, natives of Ceylon, while
I was in Colombo, addressed a remarkable
communication to the Governor-General.
They said a hundred years ago there was
established in the United States a new
theory of government—that there should
be no taxation without representation.
“Now,” they said, “we ask a share in the
government of the island. We pay taxes.
You may fix a property qualification and
say that no one having less than a thousand
pounds sterling shall share in the government.
We shall not object. You may
also fix an educational qualification. You
may say that no one but a college
graduate shall take part in the government.
We will not object. In short, you
may fix any qualification except a
racial qualification. That would not be
fair.” “And what answer have you to
make?” I asked Mr. Crosby Rolles, editor
of The Times of Ceylon. “To meet their
request,” he replied, “would mean to turn
over the government of Ceylon to them at
once, because there are 6,000 of them and
only 5,000 English men, women and children.
We must stop educating them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>What do you think of that for a remedy?
Personally. I do not think it will work, any
more than I think any rule of arbitrary repression
can endure. I cannot bring myself
to sympathize altogether with the views expressed
by Mr. Roosevelt in his recent
Guildhall speech. I take refuge in what
seems to me the larger experience and riper
judgment of Lord Curzon of Kedleston,
who in July, 1904, was also given the freedom
of the City of London in Guildhall,
and on that occasion used these words:
“Depend upon it, you will never rule the
East except through the heart, and the moment
imagination has gone out of your
Asiatic policy your empire will dwindle and
decay.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In smug complacency you may close
your doors which look toward Asia, while
you open wide those which look toward
Europe; you may refuse the Oriental admission
to your schools, while you accord
the privilege to any child of a European;
you may pile import duties mountain high,
and raise our standards of living to any
pitch of extravagance; you may build warships
without limit, and you may continue
to treat the Asian as legitimate prey. But
I am confident that it will not avail.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As a soldier, whether at Omdurman, in
the Sudan, or on 203–Metre Hill, at Port
Arthur, the man of color has shown himself
a right good fighting man; in commerce
he has, by his industry, perseverance,
ingenuity and frugality, given us pause;
and before the eternal throne his temporal
and his spiritual welfare are worth as much
as yours and mine.”</p>

as they combine the functions of an ordinary fork, a pike, a larding needle, a
needle for sewing together a roll of beef, venison, veal or the legs of a turkey, duck
or other game, stuffed or otherwise, and obviates the necessity of providing separate
utensils to serve the several purposes for which such utensils are designed. The
NEW POWER, on which the Company is now securing patents, will REVOLUTIONIZE
the entire mechanism of power and its application. It will surpass the Marconi

    <div><span class='xlarge'>How to Elevate the Moral and Civic Tone of the Negro Community</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Negroes—good, bad and indifferent—as long as they have lived in tenements, have
had to live shamefully intermingled. Formerly they were forced to live in ramshackle
tenements that had been abandoned by the whites, at exorbitant rents for wretched
accommodations. But now, thanks to the thrift and enterprise of certain progressive
Negro real estate agents, they may live in houses having the same conveniences and
accommodations as the whites. While, happily, the physical surroundings of the Negro
tenant have been radically altered, unhappily his moral surroundings remain unchanged.
How, then, can we improve his moral surroundings? Co-operation is a <i>sine qua non</i>
in the solution of this problem. Tenants MUST co-operate with their agents and
agents MUST co-operate with one another in ameliorating the moral and civic condition
of Negro communities. We can’t lean on the landlord. He is an indifferent third
party. He cares not, so to speak, whether his house is tenanted with respectable or
disrespectable tenants, so long as it is full and he gets his rents. If he’s at all concerned
about the disrespectable or respectable tenants in his house, it’s only to the extent that
he’s afraid the former may be the cause of some or all of the latter moving, thus
leaving him with some vacancies.</p>

<p class='c012'>The present moral conditions of Negro tenantry are indeed bad. The individual
efforts of certain Negro agents toward bettering the conditions have been praiseworthy,
to say the least, but as far as making any progress toward the desired goal is concerned,
such efforts must needs be and practically have been of little or no avail. What is
the desirable goal is too obvious to command explanation. But how to reach that goal
is the matter under consideration. In the first place, we repeat that the united efforts
of tenants and agents are the desideratum.</p>

<p class='c012'>Let the agent compel a prospective tenant to furnish references satisfying fair
and reasonable requirements as imposed by, agreed upon and accepted <i>in toto</i> by all
agents. The respectable tenant will be glad to do it. Any tenant not furnishing such
references should be “jim-crowed,” as it were, from decent neighborhoods.</p>

<p class='c012'>This matter of bettering the moral and civic condition of Negro communities is
a case of a wheel within a wheel. As has been emphasized before, the agent can do
absolutely nothing without co-operation. Ministers wielding great influence over large
congregations can lend a powerfully helping hand, if they will. We must all pull
together. We cannot work resultfully in factions. It is unquestionably within our
power to do it, if all others do their respective parts and the colored real estate
agent does his.</p>

the leading families in the city
and in the suburban towns than
any other medium in New York.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is located in the acknowledged
best section of the city, being in
the Henry Phipps’ Model Tenements
for Colored Families. No
other Exchange is so well patronized
by the foremost families,
many of whom have never employed
Colored Help before.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our demand for competent
Southern Help exceeds the supply
many times over. Call and register.
No charge. Bring your references.
We can place you in a
good position. If inconvenient to
pay our required office fee, you are
at liberty to take advantage of our
Credit System. This new feature
has proven extremely beneficial to
many worthy persons seeking employment.</p>

<p class='c012'>The aim of the School will be to
give its students a sufficient knowledge
of the theory and practice of
Automobile and Automobiling to enable
them to meet the emergencies
that constantly arise to make those
who complete the course competent
to run machines, take them apart
and assemble them properly, and to
make such repairs as may be necessary
and possible on the road.</p>

<p class='c012'>TUITION—Six weeks’ course, including
Shop and Road Work, $25:
installments if you wish, payable $5
on enrollment and $20 by the completion
of the fourth week.</p>

<p class='c012'>SHOP WORK—Consists of naming
all the parts of the automobile,
taking the engine and the rest of
the automobile apart and putting
them together again properly, and
making such repairs as may be
necessary and possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>ROAD WORK—When the shop
work is complete the student takes
up the operating and handling of
cars on the road until he is competent.</p>

<p class='c012'>If there is any special information
which you desire respecting the
course or opportunities in the automobile business we shall be glad to bear from you.</p>
